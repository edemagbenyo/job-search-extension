A feature-rich solution for bundled Chrome extensions! ðŸ’¯

Build Chrome extensions using
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/), with
[minimal configuration](#usage).

Use `manifest.json` as the input. Every file in the manifest will
be bundled or copied to the output folder.

## Table of Contents

- [Getting Started](#getting_started)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Features](#features)
- [API Documentation](https://github.com/extend-chrome/rollup-plugin-chrome-extension/blob/master/API.md)

## Getting started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Installation

```sh
$ npm i rollup rollup-plugin-chrome-extension@latest -D
```

Install the plugins
[Node Resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-node-resolve)
and [CommonJS](https://github.com/rollup/@rollup/plugin-commonjs)
if you plan to use npm modules.

```sh
$ npm i @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs -D
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Create a `rollup.config.js` file in your project root.

```javascript
// rollup.config.js

import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve'
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs'

import {
  chromeExtension,
  simpleReloader,
} from 'rollup-plugin-chrome-extension'

export default {
  input: 'src/manifest.json',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'esm',
  },
  plugins: [
    // always put chromeExtension() before other plugins
    chromeExtension(),
    simpleReloader(),
    // the plugins below are optional
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
  ],
}
```

Add these scripts to your `package.json` file.

```jsonc
// package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c",
    "watch": "rollup -c -w"
  }
}
```

Put your Chrome extension source code in a folder named `src` in
the root of your project and build with the following command:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Your extension build will be in the `dist` folder. It has
everything it needs: manifest, scripts, and assets (images, css,
etc...).

Install it in Chrome to test drive your extension! ðŸš—

## Features <a name = "features"></a>

### Worry Less About Your Manifest <a name = "features-manifest"></a>

`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` validates your output manifest,
so you discover mistakes when you build, not in a cryptic Chrome
alert later.

You can omit `manifest_version`, `version`, `name`, and
`description` from your source `manifest.json`. We'll fill them
out automatically from your `package.json`, if you use an npm
script to run Rollup. Just manage your version number in
`package.json` and it will reflect in your extension build.

Don't worry, any value in your source manifest will override that
value from `package.json`! ðŸ˜‰

### Reload Your Extension Automatically <a name = "features-reloader"></a>

Reloading your Chrome extension every time you change your code
can be a pain, and if you forget to reload, you're left
wondering, "Why isn't this working?"

If you include the helper plugin `simpleReloader` in your config,
when Rollup is in watch mode your background page will include an
auto-reloader script. This will reload your extension every time
Rollup produces a new build.

Ever got the error `"Extension context invalidated"` in your
content script? That happens when the extension reloads but the
content script doesn't. Our reloader makes sure that doesn't
happen by reloading your content scripts when it reloads your
extension.

### Write Chrome Extensions In TypeScript <a name = "typescript"></a>

If you use
[`@rollup/plugin-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-typescript)
in your plugins, you can write your Chrome extension in
TypeScript. That's right, the scripts in your manifest and in
your HTML script tags.

TypeScript definitions are included, so no need to install an
additional `@types` library!

### Manage Your Assets With Ease <a name = "features-assets"></a>

Your `manifest.json` doesn't only contain script files. There are
images, icons, and even CSS files. We've got you covered. These
assets are automatically copied into the output folder. Even the
images in your HTML files get copied over.

### Bundle Everything In Your HTML Files <a name = "features-html"></a>

What about your Options and Popup pages?
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` uses the JS or even TS files in
your HTML files as entry points. Shared code is split out into
chunks automatically, so libraries like React and Lodash aren't
bundled into your extension multiple times.

### Derive Permissions Automatically <a name = "features-permissions"></a>

`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` statically analyzes your bundled
code to detect required permissions to declare in the manifest.
Any permissions in the source manifest are always included.

### Use ES2015 Modules In Your Scripts <a name = "features-modules"></a>

Chrome extensions don't support modules in background and content
scripts. We've developed a
[module loader](#dynamic-import-wrapper) specifically for Chrome
extension scripts, so you can take advantage of Rollup's great
code splitting features.

### Plugins Take It To The Next Level <a name = ""></a>

Take advantage of other great Rollup plugins to do awesome things
with your Chrome extensions!

Some of our favorites are:

- Write your extension in TS with
  [`@rollup/plugin-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-typescript)
- Import CSS in JS files with
  [`rollup-plugin-postcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-postcss)
- Zip your extension when you build with
  [`rollup-plugin-zip`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-zip).

Two of our own plugins:

- Import a module as a string of code to use in
  `chrome.runtime.executeScript` with
  [`rollup-plugin-bundle-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-bundle-imports)
- Empty your output folder before a new build with
  [`rollup-plugin-empty-dir`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-empty-dir)
